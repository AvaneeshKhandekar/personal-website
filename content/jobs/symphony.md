- Developed a fuse box assembly defect detection system by identifying incorrect fuse placements based on their colors.
This eliminated human inspection, reduced operating expenses, and intensive labor required in quality control
- Used Image Processing, and a two step Neural Network to detect improper fuse box configurations in images, videos, and
live feeds. The model was created using TensorFlow and Faster RCNN models, fine-tuning them for efficiency and
performance after creating and augmenting the dataset through various techniques
- Packaged the model as desktop application with a full GUI for better usage and added certain business requirements
like aggregating the result as a report in PDF format displaying results for each fuse box, elaborate charts, the total error
rate, and most frequent errors for auditing purposes
