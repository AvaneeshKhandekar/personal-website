UniBazaar is a hyper-localized marketplace built for university students to buy, sell, and trade second-hand items within their campus communities. The platform is powered by microservices in Golang for products and users, with a React frontend for a seamless user experience. MongoDB handles product listings, while PostgreSQL manages user data. Images are stored securely on AWS, and the application is deployed on Azure for hosting web services and apps. Docker is used for containerized deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability. UniBazaar enables direct bidding and negotiations, making campus trading efficient, secure, and accessible.
