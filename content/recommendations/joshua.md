I had the pleasure of working with Avaneesh on a project modernizing an internal advisor system onto AWS for our client. He was one of our full stack developers on the team. He has excellent knowledge on both the functional and technical side of the project. He was able to complete his sprints on time and help others on the team if anyone required any help to close their development. I highly recommend bringing him on your project.
